# An Interpretable Slope Displacement Decomposition Model Based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks

The  Physics - Informed Neural Network (PINN) methods were employed to decompose slope displacement. This decomposition was carried out considering factors such as rainfall, blasting, creep, and excavation.
