# Displacement-decomposition-based-on-PINN-and-BPNN
The Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) and Physics - Informed Neural Network (PINN) methods were employed to decompose slope displacement. This decomposition was carried out considering factors such as rainfall, blasting, creep, and excavation.
