# An Interpretable Slope Displacement Decomposition Model Based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks

The  Physics - Informed Neural Network (PINN) methods were employed to decompose slope displacement. This decomposition was carried out considering factors such as rainfall, blasting, creep, and excavation.


## Project Structure

- **`model.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data processing, model training, and result visualization.
- **`example_data/`**: This directory holds the example input data required to run the notebook.
- **`example_results/`**: This directory is used to store the output results generated by the model, such as plots and spreadsheets.
- **`data and results/`**: This directory contains supplementary data or a mix of raw data and final results.
/Due to model deployment considerations and computational resource limitations, the model weights trained on the original dataset have not been uploaded. The example data is simulated based on the raw data and allows for relatively fast training.
